Project Reflection

Leadership: We all led at different times during the project depending on the problem we were facing, as we all have diverse experiences, so we utilised them.
Work sharing: So we all chose different parts where we understood more to start with
Team tools: Microsoft Teams (meeting), Trello, canvas, the Scrum approach, GitHub, Slack
Technical Knowledge sharing: More communication and use of tutorials, video clips

# Module 15: Final Projects

## Overview

Welcome to the Final Project! You are nearing the end of your journey in this class. With your team, you will conceive and execute a design for a client-side single-page application.

Because you will be working collaboratively, you will continue to use agile development methodologies and implement feature and bug fixes using git branch workflow and pull requests.

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-ready if you are able to:

* Speak technically about a feature you implemented in your project

* Explain and execute git branching workflow in a collaborative project

* Resolve merge conflicts

* Design, build, and deploy a client-side single-page application using Netlify

* Prepare a professional presentation and repository README for your project

## Project

With your team, you'll conceive and execute a design for a client-side single-page application. You will implement feature and bug fixes using git branch workflow and pull requests.

You will write your own user stories and acceptance criteria in GitHub Issues to help your team stay on track with the project. Using GitHub Project as a means to track the status of your project tasks will help you understand the benefits of Kanban boards.

## Heads-Up

In the next module, you'll continue to work on your group projects. You'll end the week by presenting your project to your class. Once your project is complete, you'll want to update your professional materials and add your new project to your portfolio.
